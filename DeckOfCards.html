          <h1>Assignment: Deck of Cards</h1>
          <h3>Create a Deck class. A deck should have the following functionality:</h3>
          <ul>
               <li>The Deck should contain the 52 standard cards</li>
               <li>The Deck should be able to shuffle</li>
               <li>The Deck should be able to reset</li>
               <li>The Deck should be able to deal a random card</li>
               <li>Deal should return the card that was dealt and remove it from the deck</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Now create a Player class. A Player should have the following functionality:</h3>
          <ul>
               <li>The Player should have a name</li>
               <li>The Player should have a hand</li>
               <li>The Player should be able to take a card (use the deck.deal method)</li>
               <li>The Player should be able to discard a card</li>
