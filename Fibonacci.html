          <h1>Assignment: Fib + Nacci</h1>
          <p>The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence where each number is the sum of its two predecessors. The sequence starts off like so: (0), 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc. The 0 is in parenthesis because it helps the sequence get started but it is not actually part of the sequence.</p>
